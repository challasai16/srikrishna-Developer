                            <p>Banks carry out an independent valuation to determine whether purchase is in line with the existing market price of the area where property exists. Valuation is the key yardstick in determining the loan amount that can be sanctioned by the bank. The valuation issue rarely arises when property in Hyderabad is purchased from a reputed builder and the residential apartment is a pre approved one.</p>
